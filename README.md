# React Movie App with TypeScript & Tailwind CSS

![React Movie App Demo](./public/demo.png)

> A modern and responsive web application for browsing, searching, and favoriting movies, built from scratch with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project leverages the [The Movie Database (TMDB) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to provide up-to-date movie information.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Browse Popular Movies**: View a grid of the most popular movies currently trending.
- **Real-time Search**: Search for movies by title with instant results.
- **Optimized API Requests**: Implemented a custom `useDebounce` hook to prevent excessive API calls while typing.
- **Detailed Movie Information**: Click on any movie to see a dedicated page with its poster, summary, rating, runtime, and more.
- **Favorites System**: Add or remove movies from a personal "Favorites" list.
- **Persistent Data**: Favorites are saved to the browser's `localStorage`, so they persist across sessions.
- **Fully Responsive Design**: The UI is built with Tailwind CSS and adapts beautifully to all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
